My program is designed to enforce Mandatory Access Control (MAC) for different security levels of document access. Hereâ€™s how I structured it:

I use `strtok` to parse the `mac.policy` file. This extracts usernames and their security levels efficiently
It utilizes a dynamic array to manage security levels, making access checks straightforward and efficient
Memory for strings is allocated precisely when needed, ensuring efficient use of resources
I relied on `strlen` quite a bit throughout the program to manage string operations, due to the limitations of `strtok` and `getline` which do not provide length data

This implementation ensures strict adherence to the specified MAC protocols, regulating file access based on user security clearance effectively
