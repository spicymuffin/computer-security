My program heavily utilizes strtok to parse strings,
A linked list to keep track of the people in the HOUSE
A simple dynamic array thing to store keys
All space for strings is allocated after figuring out the length of the string, when the space is required
Lots of calls to strlen, unfortunately, since strtok and getline dont return length data
