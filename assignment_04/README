It does use objcopy to add/update sections.
The signature creation algorithm is just concatenating all the execuatable sections with SHF_EXECINSTR flag in
executable segments (with PF_X set).
To do the actual signing I used RSA with SHA-256, as implemented by OpenSSL's EVP interface. (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 + SHA-256)
Verification is done in the same way.
I modified cas4109.c because it didnt support updating signatures.

To solve part B i had to modify the .rela.dyn's entry with offset 0x4010 to 0x130b (which is the address of do_nothing).
We have to go through .rela.dyn and not through .data because this elf file was compiled with -fPIE.
