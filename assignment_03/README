I used EVP_BytesToKey bc i noticed that for small shared.key values the function EVP_EncryptInit_ex
behaved in a weird way

The thing isnt using streamed reads and writes so if the file is big it IS going to run out of random
It uses the same 32 byte key for AES512-CTR and HMAC-SHA256 which is bad ig but i cba at this point

the HMAC tag is calculated on ciphertext+IV so IV cant be tampered with (i missed that at first, actually)

dbgutil is for dynamic debugging toggling
fileutil does the file operations

make run to test quick
